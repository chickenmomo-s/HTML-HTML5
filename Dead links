<!-- Make Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol -->
  Sometimes you want to add anchor attributes to your website before you know where they will link.
    This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript.
    
<!-- Create a dead link -->

    To create a dead link, just replace the value of href attribute with #(hash symbol)
    Example -
    <a> a href"#"</a>
