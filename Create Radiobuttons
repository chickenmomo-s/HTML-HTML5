//Create a Set of Radio Buttons
You can create radiobuttons if you want the user to select one answer. 
Example - MCQs.
Radiobuttons are type of an input
  Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element.
  By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.
  
  All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group.
  By creating a radio group, 
        selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.
        
Here's an example of a radio button:

<label> 
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>

It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches the value of the id attribute of the input element.
This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the child input element. 
For example:
<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>
