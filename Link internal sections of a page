<!-- How to link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements -->
Use the a (anchor) elements to create internal links so that you can jump to different sections within a webpage.

<!-- How to create an internal link ? -->
To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute
  to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, 
  usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to.
  
Note - id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element 

Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:

<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>

<!-- When users click the Contacts link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the Contacts header element. -->

Note - 
If you want to open the link in a different window use the attribute - target="_blank"
