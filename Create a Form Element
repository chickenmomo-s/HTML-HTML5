<!-- Create a Form Element and add a submit button -->

You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using HTML. 
You can do this by specifying an action on your form element.
<!--example -->
  For example:
    <form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>
    
 By adding a sumbit button, this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your form's action attribute.
 
 Here's an example of submit button:

<button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>
